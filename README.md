Squares API

The Squares API solution is designed to enable our consumers to identify squares from 2D plane coordinates and thus make the world a better place.

This API allows to import a list of points (a pair of integer X and Y coordinates), add and delete a point to an existing list. On top of that the API returns a list and the number of squares (a set of 4 points that make up a square) that our amazing solution identified.

Functions
